Machine Learning Hooks
======================

.. note::

        Before you install machine learnings hooks, please make sure you have installed
        the Event Notification Server (:doc:`install`) and have it working properly

.. important::

        Please don't ask me basic questions like "pip3 command not found" or
        "cv2 not found" - what do I do? Hooks require some terminal
        knowledge and familiarity with troubleshooting. I don't plan to
        provide support for these hooks. They are for reference only

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Only tested with ZM 1.32+. May or may not work with older versions
- Needs Python3 (I used to support Python2, but not any more). Python2 will be deprecated in 2020. May as well update.

What
~~~~

Kung-fu machine learning goodness.

This is an example of how you can use the ``hook`` feature of the
notification server to invoke a custom script on the event before it
generates an alarm. I currently support object detection and face
recognition.

Please don't ask me questions on how to use them. Please read the
extensive documentation and ini file configs


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Option 1: Automatic install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  You need to have ``pip3`` installed. On ubuntu, it is
   ``sudo apt install python3-pip``, or see
   `this <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__
-  Clone the event server and go to the ``hook`` directory

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventnotification # if you don't already have it downloaded

    cd zmeventnotification

-  (OPTIONAL) Edit ``hook/detect_wrapper.sh`` and change:

   -  ``CONFIG_FILE`` to point to the right config file, if you changed
      paths

::

    sudo -H ./install.sh # and follow the prompts

**Note:** if you want to add "face recognition" you also need to do

::

    sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev  # not mandatory, but gives a good speed boost!
    sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition # mandatory

Takes a while and installs a gob of stuff, which is why I did not add it
automatically, especially if you don't need face recognition.

Note, if you installed ``face_recognition`` earlier without blas, do this:

.. code:: bash

  sudo -H pip3 uninstall dlib
  sudo -H pip3 uninstall face-recognition
  sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev # this is the important part
  sudo -H pip3 install dlib --verbose --no-cache-dir # make sure it finds openblas
  sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition

Option 2: Manual install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If automatic install fails for you, or you like to be in control:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventnotification # if you don't already have it downloaded


-  Install object detection files:

   .. code:: bash

       cd zmeventnotification/
       sudo -H pip3 install hook/

**Note:** if you want to add "face recognition" you also need to do

::

    sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev  # not mandatory, but gives a good speed boost!
    sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition # mandatory

Takes a while and installs a gob of stuff, which is why I did not add it
automatically, especially if you don't need face recognition.

Note, if you installed ``face_recognition`` without blas, do this:

::
        sudo -H pip3 uninstall dlib
        sudo -H pip3 uninstall face-recognition
        sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev # this is the important part
        sudo -H pip3 install dlib --verbose --no-cache-dir # make sure it finds openblas
        sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition


-  You now need to download configuration and weight files that are
   required by the machine learning magic. Note that you don't have to
   put them in ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification`` -> use whatever you want
   (and change variables in ``detect_wrapper.sh`` script if you do)

.. code:: bash

    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/zmeventnotification/images
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models

    # if you are using face recognition, create this folder
    # after that you need to copy images of faces you want to detect
    # to this folder
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/zmeventnotification/known_faces

    # if you want to use YoloV3 (slower, accurate)
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/yolov3 # if you are using YoloV3
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg -O /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/yolov3/yolov3.cfg
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/data/coco.names -O /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/yolov3/yolov3_classes.txt
    sudo wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights -O /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/yolov3/yolov3.weights

    --OR--

    # if you want to use TinyYoloV3 (faster, less accurate)
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/tinyyolo # if you are using TinyYoloV3
    sudo wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights -O /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/tinyyolo/yolov3-tiny.weights
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg -O /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/tinyyolo/yolov3-tiny.cfg
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/data/coco.names -O /var/lib/zmeventnotification/models/tinyyolo/yolov3-tiny.txt

-  Copy over the object detection config file

.. code:: bash

    sudo cp objectconfig.ini /etc/zm

-  Now make sure it all RW accessible by ``www-data`` (or ``apache``)

   ::

       sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/ #(change www-data to apache for CentOS/Fedora)

-  (OPTIONAL) Edit ``detect_wrapper.sh`` and change:

   -  ``CONFIG_FILE`` to point to the right config file, if you changed
      paths

-  Now copy your detection file to ``/usr/bin``

   ::

       sudo cp detect.py /usr/bin

Post install steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make sure you edit your installed ``objectconfig.ini`` to the right
   settings. You MUST change the ``[general]`` section for your own
   portal.
-  Make sure the ``CONFIG_FILE`` variable in ``detect_wrapper.sh`` is
   correct

Test operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/detect_wrapper.sh <eid> <mid> # replace www-data with apache if needed

This will try and download the configured frame for alarm and analyze
it. Replace with your own EID (Example 123456) The files will be in
``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/images`` For example: if you configured
``frame_id`` to be ``bestmatch`` you'll see two files
``<eid>-alarm.jpg`` and ``<eid>-snapshot.jpg`` If you configured
``frame_id`` to be ``snapshot`` or a specific number, you'll see one
file ``<eid>.jpg``

The ``<mid>`` is optional and is the monitor ID. If you do specify it,
it will pick up the right mask to apply (if it is in your config)

The above command will also try and run detection.

If it doesn't work, go back and figure out where you have a problem

-  Other configuration notes, after you get everything working

   -  Set ``delete_after_analyze`` to ``yes`` so that downloaded images
      are removed after analysis. In the default installation, the
      images are kept in ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/images`` so you
      can debug.
   -  Remember these rules:

      -  ``frame_id=snapshot`` will work for any ZM >= 1.32
      -  If you are running ZM < 1.33, to enable ``bestmatch`` or
         ``alarm`` you need to enable the monitor to store JPEG frames
         in its ZM monitor->storage configuration in ZM
      -  If you are running ZM >= 1.33, you can use all fid modes
         without requiring to enable frames in storage


Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~
To upgrade at a later stage, see :ref:`upgrade_es_hooks`.

.. _hooks-logging:

Logging
~~~~~~~~~

Starting version 4.0.x, the hooks now use ZM logging, thanks to a `python wrapper <https://pypi.org/project/pyzmutils/>`__ I wrote recently that taps into ZM's logging system. This also means it is no longer as easy as enabling ``log_level=debug`` in ``objdetect.ini``. Infact, that option has been removed. Follow standard ZM logging options for the hooks. Here is what I do:

- In ``ZM->Options->Logs:``

  - LOG_LEVEL_FILE = debug
  - LOG_LEVEL_SYSLOG = Info
  - LOG_LEVEL_DATABASE = Info
  - LOG_DEBUG is on
  - LOG_DEBUG_TARGET = ``_zmesdetect`` (if you have other targets, just separate them with ``|`` - example, ``_zmc|_zmesdetect``). If you want to enable debug logs for both the ES and the hooks, your target will look like ``_zmesdetect|_zmeventnotification``. You can also enabled debug logs for just one monitor's hooks like so: ``_zmesdetect_m5|_zmeventnotification``. This will enable debug logs only when hooks are run for monitor 5.

  The above config. will store debug logs in my ``/var/log/zm`` directory, while Info level logs will be recorded in syslog and DB.

  You will likely need to restart ZM after this.

  So now, to view hooks/detect logs, all I do is:

  ::

    tail -f  /var/log/zm/zmesdetect*.log

  Note that the detection code registers itself as ``zmesdetect`` with ZM. When it is invoked with a specific monitor ID (usually the case), then the component is named ``zmesdetect_mX.log`` where ``X`` is the monitor ID. In other words, that now gives you one log per monitor (just like ``/var/log/zm/zmc_mX.log``) which makes it easy to debug/isolate. 

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In general, I expect you to debug properly. Please don't ask me basic
   questions without investigating logs yourself
-  Always run ``detect_wrapper.sh`` in manual mode first to make sure it
   works
-  To get debug logs, Make sure your ``LOG_DEBUG`` in ZM Options->Logs is set to on and your ``LOG_DEBUG_TARGET`` option includes ``_zmesdetect`` (or is empty)
-  You can view debug logs for detection by doing ``tail -f  /var/log/zm/zmesdetect*.log``
-  One of the big reasons why object detection fails is because the hook
   is not able to download the image to check. This may be because your
   ZM version is old or other errors. Some common issues:

   -  Make sure your ``objectconfig.ini`` section for ``[general]`` are
      correct (portal, user,admin)
   -  For object detection to work, the hooks expect to download images
      of events using
      ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=snapshot`` and
      possibly ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=alarm``
   -  Open up a browser, log into ZM. Open a new tab and type in
      ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=snapshot`` in
      your browser. Replace ``eid`` with an actual event id. Do you see
      an image? If not, you'll have to fix/update ZM. Please don't ask
      me how. Please post in the ZM forums
   -  Open up a browser, log into ZM. Open a new tab and type in
      ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=alarm`` in your
      browser. Replace ``eid`` with an actual event id. Do you see an
      image? If not, you'll have to fix/update ZM. Please don't ask me
      how. Please post in the ZM forums

Types of detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can switch detection type by using
``model=<detection_type1>,<detection_type2>,....`` in your
``objectconfig.ini``

Example:

``model=yolo,hog,face`` will run full Yolo, then HOG, then face
recognition.

Note that you can change ``model`` on a per monitor basis too. Read the
comments in ``objectconfig.ini``

If you select yolo, you can add a ``model_type=tiny`` to use tiny YOLO
instead of full yolo weights. Again, please readd the comments in
``objectconfig.ini``

How to use license plate recognition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two ALPR options are provided: 

- `Plate Recognizer <https://platerecognizer.com>`__ . It uses a deep learning model that does a far better job than OpenALPR (based on my tests). The class is abstracted, obviously, so in future I may add local models. For now, you will have to get a license key from them (they have a `free tier <https://platerecognizer.com/pricing/>`__ that allows 2500 lookups per month)
- `OpenALPR <https://www.openalpr.com>`__ . While OpenALPR's detection is not as good as Plate Recognizer, when it does detect, it provides a lot more information (like car make/model/year etc.)

To enable alpr, simple add `alpr` to `models`. You will also have to add your license key to the ``[alpr]`` section of ``objdetect.ini``

This is an example config that uses plate recognizer:

::

  models = yolo,alpr

  [alpr]
  alpr_service=plate_recognizer
  # If you want to host a local SDK https://app.platerecognizer.com/sdk/
  #alpr_url=https://localhost:8080
  # Plate recog replace with your api key
  alpr_key=KEY
  # if yes, then it will log usage statistics of the ALPR service
  platerec_stats=no
  # If you want to specify regions. See http://docs.platerecognizer.com/#regions-supported
  #platerec_regions=['us','cn','kr']
  # minimal confidence for actually detecting a plate
  platerec_min_dscore=0.1
  # minimal confidence for the translated text
  platerec_min_score=0.2


This is an example config that uses OpenALPR:

::

  models = yolo,alpr

  [alpr]
  alpr_service=open_alpr
  alpr_key=SECRET

  # For an explanation of params, see http://doc.openalpr.com/api/?api=cloudapi
  openalpr_recognize_vehicle=1
  openalpr_country=us
  openalpr_state=ca
  # openalpr returns percents, but we convert to between 0 and 1
  openalpr_min_confidence=0.3

Leave ``alpr_use_after_detection_only`` to the default values. 

How license plate recognition will work
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- To save on  API calls, the code will only invoke remote APIs if a vehicle is detected
- This also means you MUST specify yolo along with alpr


How to use face recognition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Face Recognition uses
`this <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition>`__ library. Before
you try and use face recognition, please make sure you did a
``sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition`` The reason this is not
automatically done during setup is that it installs a lot of
dependencies that takes time (including dlib) and not everyone wants it.

.. sidebar:: Face recognition limitations

        Don't expect magic with overhead cameras. This library requires a
        reasonable face orientation (works for front facing, or somewhat side
        facing poses) and does not work for full profiles or completely overhead
        faces. Take a look at the `accuracy
        wiki <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/wiki/Face-Recognition-Accuracy-Problems>`__
        of this library to know more about its limitations. Also note that I found `cnn` mode is much more accurage than `hog` mode. However, `cnn` comes with a speed and memory tradeoff.

Configuring face recognition
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Make sure you have images of people you want to recognize in
   ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/known_faces``
-  Only one image per person
-  For example, you may have the following image setup:

   ::

       /var/lib/zmeventnotification/known_faces
           + david_gilmour.jpg
           + ramanujan.jpg
           + bruce_lee.jpg

-  When face recognition is triggered, it will load each of these files
   and if there are faces in them, will load them and compare them to
   the alarmed image

known faces images
''''''''''''''''''

-  Only put in one image per person
-  Make sure the face is recognizable
-  crop it to around 400 pixels width (doesn't seem to need bigger
   images, but experiment. Larger the image, the larger the memory
   requirements)

Yo, it can't recognize faces
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Look at debug logs.

   -  If it says "no faces loaded" that means your known images don't
      have recognizable faces
   -  If it says "no faces found" that means your alarmed image doesn't
      have a face that is recognizable
   -  Read comments about ``num_jitters``, ``model``, ``upsample_times``
      in ``objectconfig.ini``

-  Experiment. Read the accuracy wiki link I posted in the previous
   section


Performance comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DNNs perform very well on a GPU. My ZM server doesn't have a GPU. On a
Intel Xeon 3.16GHz 4Core machine:

With BLAS installed, here are my performance stats:
All tests are with a 600px wide image

- Face Detection with CNN:

::

    [|--> model:face init took: 1.901829s]
    [|--> model:face detection took: 4.218463s] (Fyi, this varies, from 4.x - 6.xs)


- Face Detection with HOG:

::

    [|--> model:face init took: 1.866364s]
    [|--> model:face detection took: 0.263436s]

- YoloV3 object detection (with full yolov3 weights)

::

    [|--> model:yolo init took: 1.9e-05s]
    [|--> model:yolo detection took: 2.487402s]



As always, if you are trying to figure out how this works, do this in 3
steps:


Manually testing if detection is working well
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can manually invoke the detection module to check if it works ok:

.. code:: bash

    ./sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/detect.py --config /etc/zm/objectconfig.ini  --eventid <eid> --monitorid <mid>

The ``--monitorid <mid>`` is optional and is the monitor ID. If you do
specify it, it will pick up the right mask to apply (if it is in your
config)


**STEP 1: Make sure the scripts(s) work** 

- Run the python script manually to see if it works (refer to sections above on how to run them manually) 
- ``./detect_wrapper.sh <eid> <mid>`` --> make sure it
  downloads a proper image for that eid. Make sure it correctly invokes
  detect.py If not, fix it. (``<mid>`` is optional and is used to apply a
  crop mask if specified) 
- Make sure the ``image_path`` you've chosen in the config file is WRITABLE by www-data (or apache) before you move to step 2

**STEP 2: run zmeventnotification in MANUAL mode** 

- ``sudo zmdc.pl stop zmeventnotification.pl`` 
- change console_logs to yes in ``zmeventnotification.ini``
-  ``sudo -u www-data ./zmeventnotification.pl  --config ./zmeventnotification.ini``
-  Force an alarm, look at logs

**STEP 3: integrate with the actual daemon** 
- You should know how to do this already
