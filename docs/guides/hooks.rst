Machine Learning Hooks
======================

.. note::

        Before you install machine learnings hooks, please make sure you have installed
        the Event Notification Server (:doc:`install`) and have it working properly

.. important::

        Please don't ask me basic questions like "pip3 command not found - what do I do?" or
        "cv2 not found, how can I install it?" Hooks require some terminal
        knowledge and familiarity with troubleshooting. I don't plan to
        provide support for these hooks. They are for reference only


Key Features 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Detection: objects, faces, License Plates
- Recognition: faces, License plates
- Platforms: 

   - CPU (object, face detection, face recognition, ALPR), 
   - GPU (object, face detection, face recognition, ALPR), 
   - EdgeTPU (object, face detection, ALPR)

- Machine learning can be installed locally with ZM, or remotely via mlapi 

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Only tested with ZM 1.32+. May or may not work with older versions
- Needs Python3.6+ (Python2 is not supported)

What
~~~~

Kung-fu machine learning goodness.

This is an example of how you can use the ``hook`` feature of the
notification server to invoke a custom script on the event before it
generates an alarm. I currently support object detection, face detection/recognition and ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition).

Please don't ask me questions on how to use them. Please read the
extensive documentation and ini/yml file configs


.. _hooks_install:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatic install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  You need to have ``pip3`` installed. On ubuntu, it is
   ``sudo apt install python3-pip``, or see
   `this <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__
-  Clone the event server repository and go to the ``hook`` directory

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/baudneo/zmeventnotification # if you don't already have it downloaded

    cd zmeventnotification

-  (OPTIONAL) Edit ``hook/zm_event_start.sh`` and change:

   -  ``CONFIG_FILE`` to point to the right config file, if you changed
      paths

::

   sudo -H ./install.sh # and follow the prompts

I use a library called `Shapely <https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely>`__ for polygon intersection checks.
Shapely requires a library called GeOS. If you see errors related to ``Failed `CDLL(libgeos_c.so)``` 
you may manually need to install libgeos  like so:

::

   sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev

**Google TPU**:
If you are planning on using Google EdgeTPU support,
you'll have to invoke the script using:

::

   sudo -H INSTALL_CORAL_EDGETPU=yes ./install.sh # and follow the prompts

EdgeTPU models/underlying libraries are not downloaded automatically. (EfficeintDet lite v3 and MobileNetv2 TF2 models added Nov 2021)

For EdgeTPU, the expectation is  that you have followed all the instructions 
at `the coral site <https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/get-started/>`__ first. 
Specifically, you need to make sure you have:

   1. Installed the right libedgetpu library (max or std)
   2. Installed the right tensorflow-lite library 
   3. Installed pycoral APIs as per `the instructions <https://coral.ai/software/#pycoral-api>`__.


If you don't, things will break. Further, you also need to make sure your 
web user has access to the coral device.

On my ubuntu system, I needed to do:

::

   sudo usermod -a -G plugdev www-data

**Very important**: You need to reboot after this, otherwise, you may notice that the TPU
code crashes when you run the ES in daemon mode (may work fine in manual mode)


.._install-specific-models:

Starting version 5.13.3, you can *optionally* choose to only install specific models by passing them as variables to the install script. The variables are labelled as ``INSTALL_<model>`` with possible values of ``yes`` (default) or ``no``. ``<model>`` is the specific model.

So for example:

::

  sudo INSTALL_YOLOV3=no INSTALL_YOLOV4=yes ./install.sh

Will only install the ``YOLOv4 (full)`` model but will skip the ``YOLOV3`` 
model.

Another example:

::

   sudo -H INSTALL_CORAL_EDGETPU=yes ./install.sh --install-es --no-install-config --install-hook

Will install the ES and hooks, but no configs and will add the coral libraries.

.. _opencv_install:

**Note:**: If you plan on using object detection, starting v5.0.0 of the ES, the setup script no longer installs opencv for you. This is because you may want to install your own version with GPU acceleration or other options. There are two options to install OpenCV:

  - You install a pip package (opencv-contrib-python). Very easy, but you don't get GPU support
  - You compile from source. Takes longer, but you get all the right modules as well as GPU support. Instructions are simple, if you follow them well.

  .. important::

    However you choose to install openCV, you need a minimum version of `4.1.1`. Using a version below that will very likely not work.


Installing OpenCV: Using the pip package (Easy, but not recommended if you plan to use OpenCV ML - example Yolo)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

::

  # Note this does NOT enable GPU support
  # It also seems to miss modules like bgsem etc

  sudo -H pip3 install opencv-contrib-python

  # NOTE: Do NOT install both opencv-contrib-python and opencv packages via pip. The contrib package includes opencv+extras


Installing OpenCV: from source (Recommended if you plan to use OpenCV ML - example Yolo)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
General installation instructions are available at the `official openCV site <https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html>`__. However, see below, if you are looking for GPU support:

If you want to install a version with GPU support, I'd recommend you install OpenCV 4.2.x because it supports a CUDA backend for deep learning. Adrian's blog has a `good howto <https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/02/03/how-to-use-opencvs-dnn-module-with-nvidia-gpus-cuda-and-cudnn/>`__ on compiling OpenCV 4.2.x from scratch.

**I would strongly recommend you build from source, if you are able to. Pre built packages are not official from OpenCV and often seem to break/seg fault on different configurations.**

.. _opencv_seg_fault:

Make sure OpenCV works
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. important::

  After you install opencv, make sure it works. Start python3 and inside the interpreter, do a ``import cv2``. If it seg faults, you have a problem with the package you installed. Like I said, I've never had issues after building from source.

  Note that if you get an error saying ``cv2 not found`` that means you did not install it in a place python3 can find it (you might have installed it for python2 by mistake)



**Note 3:** if you want to add "face recognition" you also need to do the following: (Note that if you are using Google Coral,
you can do face detection [not recognition] by using the coral libraries as well. You can skip this section if you want to use TPU based face detection)

::

    sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev  # not mandatory, but gives a good speed boost!
    sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition # mandatory

Takes a while (building DLib) and installs a gob of stuff, which is why I did not add it
automatically, especially if you don't need face recognition.

Note, if you installed ``face_recognition`` earlier without blas, do this:

.. code:: bash

  sudo -H pip3 uninstall dlib
  sudo -H pip3 uninstall face-recognition
  sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libblas-dev # this is the important part
  sudo -H pip3 install dlib --verbose --no-cache-dir # make sure it finds openblas
  sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition

Option 2: Manual install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If automatic install fails for you, or you like to be in control, take a look at what ``install.sh`` does. I used to maintain explict instructions on manual install, but its painful to keep this section in sync with ``install.sh``


Post install steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make sure you edit your installed ``objectconfig.yml`` to the right
   settings. You MUST change the ``[general]`` section for your own
   portal.
-  Make sure the ``CONFIG_FILE`` variable in ``zm_event_start.sh`` is
   correct


Test operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_event_start.sh <eid> <mid> # replace www-data with apache if needed

Replace with your own ``eid`` (Example 123456). This will be an event id for an event that you want to test. Typically,
open up the ZM console, look for an event you want to run analysis on and select the ID of the event. That is the ``eid``.
The ``mid`` is the monitor ID for the event. This is optional. If you specify it, any monitor specific settings (such as 
zones, hook customizations, etc. in ``objectconfig/mlapiconfig.ini`` will be used).

The above command will  try and run detection.

If it doesn't work, go back and figure out where you have a problem


Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~
To upgrade at a later stage, see :ref:`upgrade_es_hooks`.

Sidebar: Local vs. Remote Machine Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting v5.0, you can now choose to run the machine learning code on a separate server. 
This can free up your local ZM server resources if you have memory/CPU constraints. 
See :ref:`this FAQ entry <local_remote_ml>`.


.. _supported_models:

Which models should I use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- Starting 5.16, Google Coral Edge TPU is supported. See install instructions above.

-  Starting 5.15.6, you have the option of using YoloV3 or YoloV4. V3 is the original one
   while V4 is an optimized version by Alexey. See `here <https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet>`__.
   V4 is faster, and is supposed to be more accurate but YMMV. Note that you need a version GREATER than 4.3
   of OpenCV to use YoloV4

- If you are constrained in memory, use tinyyolo

- Each model can further be customized for accuracy vs speed by modifying parameters in
  their respective ``.cfg`` files. Start `here <https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#pre-trained-models>`__ and then
  browse the `issues list <https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/issues>`__.
  
- For face recognition, use ``face_model=cnn`` for more accuracy and ``face_model=hog`` for better speed


.. _detection_sequence:

Understanding detection configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting v6.1.0, you can chain arbitrary detection types (object, face, alpr)
and multiple models within them. In older versions, you were only allowed one model type 
per detection type. Obviously, this has required structural changes to ``objectconfig.yml`` 

This section will describe the key constructs around two important structures:

- ml_sequence (specifies sequence of ML detection steps)
- stream_sequence (specifies frame detection preferences)


6.1.0+ vs previous versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you update to 6.1.0, you may be confused with objectconfig.
Specifically, which attributes should you use and which ones are ignored?
It's pretty simple, actually.

.. note::

   use_sequence=no is no longer supported. Please make sure it is set to yes, and follow instructions 
   on how to set up ml_sequence and stream_sequence correctly 


- When ``use_sequence`` is set to ``yes`` (default is yes), ``ml_options`` and ``stream_sequence``
  structures override anything in the ``[object]``, ``[face]`` and ``[alpr]`` sections 
  Specifically, the following values are ignored in objectconfig.yml in favor of values inside the sequence structure:
   
   - frame_id, resize, delete_after_analyze, the full [object], [alpr], [face] sections 
   - any overrides related to object/face/alpr inside the [monitor] sections 
   - However, that being said, if you take a look at ``objectconfig.yml``, the sample file
     implements parameter substitution inside the structures, effectively importing the values right back in.
     Just know that what you specify in these sequence structures overrides the above attributes. 
     If you want to reuse them, you need to put them in as parameter substitutions like the same ini file has done 
   - If you are using the new ``use_sequence=yes`` please don't use old keywords as variables. They will likely fail.
     
   Example, this will **NOT WORK**:

      ::

         use_sequence=yes

         [monitor-3]
         detect_sequence='object,face,alpr'

         [monitor-4]
         detect_sequence='object'

         [ml]
         ml_sequence= {
            <...>
            general: {
               'model_sequence': '{{detection_sequence}}'
            },
            <...>

         }

   What you need to do is use a different variable name (as ``detect_sequence`` is a reserved keyword which is used if ``use_sequence=no``)
      
   But this **WILL WORK**:

      ::

         use_sequence=yes

         [monitor-3]
         my_sequence=object,face,alpr

         [monitor-4]
         my_sequence=object

         [ml]
         ml_sequence= {
            <...>
            general: {
               'model_sequence': '{{my_sequence}}'
            },
            <...>

         }

- When ``use_sequence`` is set to ``no``, zm_detect internally maps your old parameters 
  to the new structures 

Internally, both options are mapped to ``ml_sequence``, but the difference is in the parameters that are processed.
Specifically, before ES 6.1.0 came out, we had specific objectconfig fields that were used for various ML parameters
that were processed. These were primarily single, well known variable names because we only had one model type running 
per type of detection. 

More details: What happens when you go with use_sequence=no?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**NOTE**: Please use ``use_sequence=yes``. In the past, I've allowed a mode where legacy settings were converted
to ``stream_sequence`` auto-magically when I changed formats. This caused a lot of issues and was a 
nightmare to maintain. So please migrate to the proper format. If you've been using ``use_sequence=no``
it will likely break things, but please read the help and convert properly. ``use_sequence=no`` is no 
longer maintained.


In the old way, the following 'global' variables (which could be overriden on a per monitor basis) defined how
ML would work:

- ``xxx_max_processes`` and ``xxx_max_lock_wait`` that defined semaphore locks for each model (to control parallel memory consumption)
- All the ``object_xxx`` variables that define the model file, name file, and a host of other parameters that are specific to object detection 
- All the ``face_xxx`` variables, ``known_images_path``, `unknown_images_path``, ``save_unknown_*`` attributes that define the model file, name file, and a host of other parameters that are specific to face detection 
- All the ``alpr_xxx`` variables that define the model file, name file, and a host of other parameters that are specific to alpr detection 

When you make ``use_sequence=no`` in your config, I have a function called ``convert_config_to_ml_sequence()`` (see `here <https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventnotification/blob/v6.1.6/hook/zmes_hook_helpers/utils.py#L30>`__)
that basically picks up those variable, maps it to an ``ml_sequence`` structure with exactly one model per sequence (like it was before).
It picks up the sequence of models from ``detection_sequence`` which was the old way.

Further, in this mode, a ``sream_sequence`` structure is internally created that picks up values from the old
attributes, ``detection_mode``, ``frame_id``, ``bestmatch_order``, ``resize``

Therefore, the concept here was, if you choose not to use the new detection sequence, you _should_ be able to continue using your old
variables and the code will internally map.

More details: What happens when you go with use_sequence=yes?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When you go with ``yes``, ``zm_detect.py`` does NOT try to map any of the old variables. Instead, it directly
loads whatever is defined inside ``ml_sequence`` and ``stream_sequence``. However, you will notice that the default
``ml_sequence`` and ``stream_sequence`` are pre-filled with template variables. 

For example:

::

   ml_sequence= {
	   <snip>
		'object': {
			'general':{
				'pattern':'{{object_detection_pattern}}',
				'same_model_sequence_strategy': 'first' # also 'most', 'most_unique's
			},
			'sequence': [{
				#First run on TPU with higher confidence
				'object_weights':'{{tpu_object_weights}}',
				'object_labels': '{{tpu_object_labels}}',
				'object_min_confidence': {{tpu_min_confidence}},
            <snip>
				
			},
			{
				# YoloV4 on GPU if TPU fails (because sequence strategy is 'first')
				'object_config':'{{yolo4_object_config}}',
				'object_weights':'{{yolo4_object_weights}}',
				'object_labels': '{{yolo4_object_labels}}',


Note the variables inside ``{{}}``. They will be replaced when the structure is formed. And you'll note some are old 
style variables (example ``object_detection_pattern``) along with may new ones. So here is the thing:
You can use any variable names you want in the new style. Obviously, we can't use ``object_weights`` as the only variable 
if we plan to chain different models. They'll have different values. 

So remember, the config presented here is a **SAMPLE**. You are **expected to change them**.

So in the new way, if you want to change ``ml_sequence`` or ``stream_sequence`` on a per monitor basis, you have 2 choices:
- Put variables inside the main ``*_sequence`` options and simply redefine those variables on a per monitor basis
- Or, redo the entire structure on a per monitor basis. I like Option 1. 


Understanding ml_sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``ml_sequence`` structure lies in the ``[ml]`` section of ``objectconfig.yml`` (or ``mlapiconfig.ini`` if using mlapi).
At a high level, this is how it is structured (not all attributes have been described):

::

   ml_sequence = {
      'general': {
         'model_sequence':'<comma separated detection_type>'
      },
      '<detection_type>': {
         'general': {
            'pattern': '<pattern>',
            'same_model_sequence_strategy':'<strategy>'
         },
         'sequence:[{
            <series of configurations>
         },
         {
            <series of configurations>
         }]
      }
   }

**Explanation:**

- The ``general`` section at the top level specify characterstics that apply to all elements inside 
  the structure. 

   - ``model_sequence`` dictates the detection types (comma separated). Example ``object,face,alpr`` will
     first run object detection, then face, then alpr

- Now for each detection type in ``model_sequence``, you can specify the type of models you want to leading
  along with other related paramters.

  **Note**: If you are using mlapi, there are certain parameters that get overriden by ``objectconfig.yml``
  See :ref:`mlapi_overrides`

Leveraging same_model_sequence_strategy and frame_strategy effectively
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When we allow model chaining, the question we need to answer is 'How deep do we want to go to get what we want?'
That is what these attributes offer. 

``same_model_sequence_strategy`` is part ``ml_sequence``  with the following possible values:

   - ``first`` - When detecting objects, if there are multiple fallbacks, break out the moment we get a match
      using any object detection library (Default)
   - ``most`` - run through all libraries, select one that has most object matches
   - ``most_unique`` - run through all libraries, select one that has most unique object matches

``frame_strategy`` is part of ``stream_sequence`` with the following possible values:

   - 'most_models': Match the frame that has matched most models (does not include same model alternatives) (Default)
   - 'first': Stop at first match 
   - 'most': Match the frame that has the highest number of detected objects
   - 'most_unique' Match the frame that has the highest number of unique detected objects
           

**A proper example:**

Take a look at `this article <https://medium.com/zmninja/multi-frame-and-multi-model-analysis-533fa1d2799a>`__ for a walkthrough.

**All options:**

``ml_sequence`` supports various other attributes. Please see `the pyzm API documentation <https://pyzm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/pyzm.html#pyzm.ml.detect_sequence.DetectSequence>`__
that describes all options. The ``options`` parameter is what you are looking for.

Understanding stream_sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``stream_sequence`` structure lies in the ``[ml]`` section of ``objectconfig.yml``.
At a high level, this is how it is structured (not all attributes have been described):

::

   stream_sequence = {
        'frame_set': '<series of frame ids>',
        'frame_strategy': 'most_models',
        'contig_frames_before_error': 5,
        'max_attempts': 3,
        'sleep_between_attempts': 4,
		  'resize':800

    }

**Explanation:**

- ``frame_set`` defines the set of frames it should use for analysis (comma separated)
- ``frame_strategy`` defines what it should do when a match has been found
- ``contig_frames_before_error``: How many contiguous errors should occur before giving up on the series of frames 
- ``max_attempts``: How many times to try each frame (before counting it as an error in the ``contig_frames_before_error`` count)
- ``sleep_between_attempts``: When an error is encountered, how many seconds to wait for retrying 
- ``resize``: what size to resize frames too (useful if you want to speed things up and/or are running out of memory)

**A proper example:**

Take a look at `this article <https://medium.com/zmninja/multi-frame-and-multi-model-analysis-533fa1d2799a>`__ for a walkthrough.

**All options:**

``stream_sequence`` supports various other attributes. Please see `the pyzm API documentation <https://pyzm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/pyzm.html#pyzm.ml.detect_sequence.DetectSequence.detect_stream>`__
that describes all options. The ``options`` parameter is what you are looking for.


How ml_sequence and stream_sequence work together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like this:

::

   for each frame in stream sequence:
      perform stream_sequence actions on each frame
      for each model_sequence in ml_options:
      if detected, use frame_strategy (in stream_sequence) to decide if we should try other model sequences
         perform general actions:
            for each model_configuration in ml_options.sequence:
               detect()
               if detected, use same_model_sequence_strategy to decide if we should try other model configurations
      

.. _mlapi_overrides:

Exceptions when using mlapi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using the remote mlapi server, then most of these settings migrate to ``mlapiconfig.ini``
Specifically, when ``zm_detect.py`` sees ``ml_gateway`` in its ``[remote]`` section, it passes on 
the detection work to mlapi. 

**NOTE**: Please use ``use_sequence=yes``. In the past, I've allowed a mode where legacy settings were converted
to ``stream_sequence`` auto-magically when I changed formats. This caused a lot of issues and was a 
nightmare to maintain. So please migrate to the proper format. If you've been using ``use_sequence=no``
it will likely break things, but please read the help and convert properly. ``use_sequence=no`` is no 
longer maintained.

Here are a list of parameters that still need to be in ``objectconfig.yml`` when using mlapi.
(A simple rule to remember is zm_detect.py uses ``objectconfig.yml`` while mlapi uses ``mlapiconfig.ini``)

- ``ml_gateway`` (obviously, as the *ES* calls *zm_detect*, and zm_detect calls mlapi if this parameter is present in *objectconfig.yml*)
- ``ml_fallback_local`` (if *mlapi* fails, or is not running, *zm_detect* will switch to local inferencing, so this needs to be in *objectconfig.yml*)
- ``show_percent`` (*zm_detect* is the one that actually creates the text you see in your object detection (*detected:[s] person:90%*))
- ``write_image_to_zm`` (zm_detect is the one that actually puts *objdetect.jpg* in the ZM events folder - *mlapi* can't because it can be remote)
- ``write_debug_image`` (*zm_detect* is the one that creates a debug image to inspect)
- ``poly_thickness`` (because *zm_detect* is the one that actually writes the image/debug image as described above, makes sense that *poly_thickness* needs to be here)
- ``image_path`` (related to above - to know where to write the image )
- ``create_animation`` (*zm_detect* has the code to put the animation of mp4/gif together)
- ``animation_types`` (same as above)
- ``show_models`` (if you want to show model names along with text)

These need to be present in both mlapiconfig.ini and objectconfig.yml

- ``secrets``
- ``base_data_path``
- ``api_portal``
- ``portal``
- ``user``
- ``password``


So when using mlapi, migrate configurations that you typically specify in ``objectconfig.yml`` to ``mlapiconfig.ini``. This includes:

- Monitor specific sections 
- ml_sequence and stream_sequence 
- In general, if you see detection with mlapi missing something that worked when using 
  objectconfig.yml, make sure you have not missed anything specific in mlapiconfig.ini 
  with respect to related parameters 

Also note that if you are using ml_fallback, repeat the settings in both configs.

Here is a part of my config, for example:

::

   import_zm_zones=yes
   ## Monitor specific settings
   [monitor-3]
   # doorbell
   model_sequence=object,face
   object_detection_pattern=(person|monitor_doorbell)
   valid_face_area=184,235 1475,307 1523,1940 146,1940

   [monitor-7]
   # Driveway
   model_sequence=object,alpr
   object_detection_pattern=(person|car|motorbike|bus|truck|boat)

   [monitor-2]
   # Front lawn 
   model_sequence=object
   object_detection_pattern=(person)

   [monitor-4]
   #deck
   object_detection_pattern=(person|monitor_deck)
   stream_sequence = {
         'frame_strategy': 'most_models',
         'frame_set': 'alarm',
         'contig_frames_before_error': 5,
         'max_attempts': 3,
         'sleep_between_attempts': 4,
         'resize':800

      }

About specific detection types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

License plate recognition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three ALPR options are provided: 

- `Plate Recognizer <https://platerecognizer.com>`__ . It uses a deep learning model that does a far better job than OpenALPR (based on my tests). The class is abstracted, obviously, so in future I may add local models. For now, you will have to get a license key from them (they have a `free tier <https://platerecognizer.com/pricing/>`__ that allows 2500 lookups per month)
- `OpenALPR <https://www.openalpr.com>`__ . While OpenALPR's detection is not as good as Plate Recognizer, when it does detect, it provides a lot more information (like car make/model/year etc.)
- `OpenALPR command line <http://doc.openalpr.com/compiling.html>`__. This is a basic version of OpenALPR that can be self compiled and executed locally. It is far inferior to the cloud services and does NOT use any form of deep learning. However, it is free, and if you have a camera that has a good view of plates, it will work.

``alpr_service`` defined the service to be used.

Face Dection & Recognition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When it comes to faces, there are two aspects (that many often confuse):

- Detecting a Face
- Recognizing a Face 

Face Detection 
'''''''''''''''
If you only want "face detection", you can use either dlib/face_recognition or Google's TPU. Both are supported.
Take a look at ``objectconfig.yml`` for how to set them up.

Face Detection + Face Recognition
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Face Recognition uses
`this <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition>`__ library. Before
you try and use face recognition, please make sure you did a
``sudo -H pip3 install face_recognition`` The reason this is not
automatically done during setup is that it installs a lot of
dependencies that takes time (including dlib) and not everyone wants it.

.. sidebar:: Face recognition limitations

        Don't expect magic with overhead cameras. This library requires a
        reasonable face orientation (works for front facing, or somewhat side
        facing poses) and does not work for full profiles or completely overhead
        faces. Take a look at the `accuracy
        wiki <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/wiki/Face-Recognition-Accuracy-Problems>`__
        of this library to know more about its limitations. Also note that I found `cnn` mode is much more accurage than `hog` mode. However, `cnn` comes with a speed and memory tradeoff.

Using the right face recognition modes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Face recognition uses dlib. Note that in ``objectconfig.yml`` you have two options of face detection/recognition. Dlib has two modes of operation (controlled by ``face_model``). Face recognition works in two steps:
  - A: Detect a face
  - B: Recognize a face

``face_model`` affects step A. If you use ``cnn`` as a value, it will use a DNN to detect a face. If you use ``hog`` as a value, it will use a much faster method to detect a face. ``cnn`` is *much* more accurate in finding faces than ``hog`` but much slower. In my experience, ``hog`` works ok for front faces while ``cnn`` detects profiles/etc as well. 

Step B kicks in only after step A succeeds (i.e. a face has been detected). The algorithm used there is common irrespective of whether you found a face via ``hog`` or ``cnn``.

Configuring face recognition directories
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Make sure you have images of people you want to recognize in
   ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/known_faces``
- You can have multiple faces per person
- Typical configuration:

:: 

  known_faces/
    +----------bruce_lee/
                +------1.jpg
                +------2.jpg
    +----------david_gilmour/
            +------1.jpg
            +------img2.jpg
            +------3.jpg
    +----------ramanujan/
            +------face1.jpg
            +------face2.jpg


In this example, you have 3 names, each with different images.

- It is recommended that you now train the images by doing:

::

  sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_train_faces.py


If you find yourself running out of memory while training, use the size argument like so:

::

     sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_train_faces.py --size 800

   
   
- Note that you do not necessarily have to train it first but I highly recommend it. 
  When detection runs, it will look for the trained file and if missing, will auto-create it. 
  However, detection may also load yolo and if you have limited GPU resources, you may run out of memory when training. 

-  When face recognition is triggered, it will load each of these files
   and if there are faces in them, will load them and compare them to
   the alarmed image

known faces images
''''''''''''''''''
-  Make sure the face is recognizable
-  crop it to around 800 pixels width (doesn't seem to need bigger
   images, but experiment. Larger the image, the larger the memory
   requirements)
- crop around the face - not a tight crop, but no need to add a full body. A typical "passport" photo crop, maybe with a bit more of shoulder is ideal.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In general, I expect you to debug properly. Please don't ask me basic
   questions without investigating logs yourself
-  Always run ``zm_event_start.sh`` or ``zm_detect.py`` in manual mode first to make sure it
   works
-  Make sure you've set up debug logging as described in :ref:`es-hooks-logging`
-  One of the big reasons why object detection fails is because the hook
   is not able to download the image to check. This may be because your
   ZM version is old or other errors. Some common issues:

   -  Make sure your ``objectconfig.yml`` section for ``[general]`` are
      correct (portal, user,admin)
   -  For object detection to work, the hooks expect to download images
      of events using
      ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=snapshot`` and
      possibly ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=alarm``
   -  Open up a browser, log into ZM. Open a new tab and type in
      ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=snapshot`` in
      your browser. Replace ``eid`` with an actual event id. Do you see
      an image? If not, you'll have to fix/update ZM. Please don't ask
      me how. Please post in the ZM forums
   -  Open up a browser, log into ZM. Open a new tab and type in
      ``https://yourportal/zm/?view=image&eid=<eid>&fid=alarm`` in your
      browser. Replace ``eid`` with an actual event id. Do you see an
      image? If not, you'll have to fix/update ZM. Please don't ask me
      how. Please post in the ZM forums

.. _debug_reporting_hooks:

Debugging and reporting problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reporting Problems:

1. Make sure you have debug logging enabled as described in :ref:`es-hooks-logging`
2. Don't just post the final error message. Please post _full_ debug logs. 

If you have problems with hooks, there are two areas of failure:

- The ES is unable to unable to invoke hooks properly (missing files/etc)

   - This will be reported in ES logs. See :ref:`this section <debug_reporting_es>`

- Hooks don't work

   - This is covered in this section 

- The wrapper script (typically ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_event_start.sh`` is not able to run ``zm_detect.py``)

   - This won't be covered in either logs (I need to add logging for this...)


To understand what is going wrong with hooks, I like to do things the following way:

- Stop the ES if it is running (``sudo zmdc.pl stop zmeventnotification.pl``) so that we don't mix up what we are debugging
  with any new events that the ES may generate 

- Next, I take a look at ``/var/log/zm/zmeventnotification.log`` for the event that invoked a hook. Let's take 
  this as an example:

::

   01/06/2021 07:20:31.936130 zmeventnotification[28118].DBG [main:977] [|----> FORK:DeckCamera (6), eid:182253 Invoking hook on event start:'/var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_event_start.sh' 182253 6 "DeckCamera" " stairs" "/var/cache/zoneminder/events/6/2021-01-06/182253"]


Let's assume the above is what I want to debug, so then I run zm_detect manually like so:

::

   sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py --config /etc/zm/objectconfig.yml --debug --eventid 182253  --monitorid 6 --eventpath=/tmp


Note that instead of ``/var/cache/zoneminder/events/6/2021-01-06/182253`` as the event path, I just use ``/tmp`` as it is easier for me. Feel free to use the actual
event path (that is where objdetect.jpg/json are stored if an object is found). 

This will print debug logs on the terminal.


Performance comparison 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1660 v3 @ 3.00GHz 8 cores, with 32GB RAM
* GPU: GeForce 1050Ti
* TPU: Google Coral USB stick, running on USB 3.0 in 'standard' mode 
* Environment: I am running using mlapi, so you will see load time only once across multiple runs 
* Image size: 800px

The TPU is running in standard mode, not max. Also note that these figures use pycoral, which is a python
wrapper around the TPU C++ libraries. 
You should also look at  Google's Coral `coral benchmark site <https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/benchmarks/>`__ for better numbers.
Note that their performance figures are specific to their C++ code. Python will have 
additional overheads (as noted on their site)
Finally, if you are facing data transfter/delegate loading issues considering buying a good quality USB 3.1/10Gbps rated
cable. I faced intermittent issues with delegate load issues (not always) which seems to have gone away after I ditched 
Google's cable with a good quality one (I bought `this one <https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Certified-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B07213D35X/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=usb+3.1+anker+usb+c&qid=1611410490&sr=8-4>`__)

Manually testing if detection is working well
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can manually invoke the detection module to check if it works ok:

.. code:: bash

    sudo -u www-data /var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin/zm_detect.py --config /etc/zm/objectconfig.yml  --eventid <eid> --monitorid <mid> --debug

The ``--monitorid <mid>`` is optional and is the monitor ID. If you do
specify it, it will pick up the right mask to apply (if it is in your
config)


**STEP 1: Make sure the scripts(s) work** 

- Run the python script manually to see if it works (refer to sections above on how to run them manually) 
- ``./zm_event_start.sh <eid> <mid>`` --> make sure it
  downloads a proper image for that eid. Make sure it correctly invokes
  detect.py If not, fix it. (``<mid>`` is optional and is used to apply a
  crop mask if specified) 
- Make sure the ``image_path`` you've chosen in the config file is WRITABLE by www-data (or apache) before you move to step 2

**STEP 2: run zmeventnotification in MANUAL mode** 

- ``sudo zmdc.pl stop zmeventnotification.pl`` 
- change console_logs to yes in ``zmeventnotification.ini``
-  ``sudo -u www-data ./zmeventnotification.pl  --config ./zmeventnotification.ini``
-  Force an alarm, look at logs

**STEP 3: integrate with the actual daemon** 
- You should know how to do this already
