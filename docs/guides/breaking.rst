Breaking Changes
----------------

Version 5.2 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- `use_hooks` is a new attribute that controls whether hooks will be used or not
- `send_event_end_notification` is a new attribute that controls whether end notifications are sent 

Version 5.0 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``install.sh`` no longer tries to install opencv on its own. You will have to install ``opencv`` and ``opencv-contrib`` on your own. See install instructions in :doc:`hooks`.

- The ``hook_script`` attribute is deprecated. You now have ``hook_on_event_start`` and ``hook_on_event_end`` which lets you invoke different scripts when an event starts or ends. You also have the concepts of channels, that allows you to decide whether to send a notification even if hooks don't return anything. Read up about ``notify_on_hook_success`` and ``notify_on_hook_fail`` in  ``zmeventnotification.ini`` 

- Now that we support pre/post event hooks, the script names have changed too (``zm_detect_wrapper.sh`` is ``zm_event_start.sh`` and we have a new script called ``zm_event_end.sh`` that is really just a dummy script. Change it to what you need to do at the end of an event, if you enable event end notifications)

- You can now offload the entire machine learning processes to a remote server. All you need to do is to use ``ml_gateway`` and related options in ``objectconfig.ini``. The "ML gateway" is `my mlapi project <https://github.com/pliablepixels/mlapi>`__

- The ES now supports a ``restart_interval`` config item in ``zmeventnotification.ini``. If not 0, this will restart the ES after those many seconds (example ``7200`` is 2 hours). This may be needed if you find the ES locking up after a few hours. I think 5.0 resolves this locking issue (see `this issue <https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventnotification/issues/175>`__) but if it doesn't use this, umm, hack for now.


Version 4.6 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- If you are using hooks, make sure you run ``sudo ./install.sh`` again - it will create additional files in ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification``
- The hook files ``detect.py`` and ``detect_wrapper.sh`` are now called ``zm_detect.py`` and ``zm_detect_wrapper.sh``.  Furthermore, these scripts no longer reside in ``/usr/bin``. They will now reside in ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/bin``. I suppose I did not need to namespace and move, but I thought of the latter after I did the namespace changing.
- If you are using face recognition, 4.6.1 and above now allow multiple faces per person. Note that it is recommended you train them before you run detection. See the documentation for it in :doc:`hooks`.


Version 4.4 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- If you are using picture messaging, then the URL format has changed. Please REMOVE ``&username=<user>&password=<passwd>`` from the URL and put them into the ``picture_portal_username`` and ``picture_portal_password`` fields respectively


Version 4.1 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Hook versions will now always be ``<ES version>.x``, so in this case ``4.1.x``
- Hooks have now migrated to using a `proper python ZM logger module <https://pypi.org/project/pyzmutils/>`__ so it better integrates with ZM logging 
- To view detection logs, you now need to follow the standard ZM logging process. See :ref:`hooks-logging` documentation for more details)
- You no longer have to manually install python requirements, the setup process should automatically install them
- If you are using MQTT and your  ``MQTT:Simple`` library was installed a while ago, you may need to update it. A new ``login`` method was added
  to that library on Dec 2018 which is required (`ref <https://github.com/Juerd/Net-MQTT-Simple/blob/cf01b43c27893a07185d4b58ff87db183d08b0e9/Changes#L21>`__)


Version 3.9 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Hooks now add ALPR, so you need to run `sudo -H pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- See modified objectconfig.ini if you want to add ALPR. Currently works with platerecognizer.com, so you will need an API key. See hooks docs for more info

Version 3.7 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- There were some significant changes to ZM (will be part of 1.34), which includes migration to Bcrypt for passwords. Changes were made to support Bcrypt, which means you will have to add additional libraries. See the installation guide.

version 3.3 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Please use ``yes`` or ``no`` instead of ``1`` and ``0`` in ``zmeventnotification.ini`` to maintain consistency with ``objectconfig.ini``
- In ``zmeventnotification.ini``, ``store_frame_in_zm`` is now ``hook_pass_image_path``

version 3.2 onwards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changes in paths for everything. - event server config file now defaults to ``/etc/zm`` 
- hook config now defaults to ``/etc/zm`` 
- Push token file now defaults to ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification/push`` 
- all object detection data files default to ``/var/lib/zmeventnotification``
- If you are migrating from a previous version: 
        - Make a copy of your ``/etc/zmeventnotification.ini`` and ``/var/detect/objectconfig.ini`` (if you are using hooks) 
        - Run ``sudo -H ./install.sh`` again inside the repo, let it set up all the files 
        - Compare your old config files to the news ones at ``/etc/zm`` and make necessary changes 
        - Make sure everything works well 
        - You can now delete the old ``/var/detect`` folder as well as ``/etc/zmeventnotification.ini`` 
        - Run zmNinja again to make sure its token is registered in the new tokens file (in ``/var/lib/zmeeventnotification/push/tokens.txt``)
