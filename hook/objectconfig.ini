## Monitor specific settings
#
# - Format:  [monitor-<mid>]
#
# Parameters:
# polygon areas where object detection will be done.
# You can name them anything except the keywords defined in the optional
# params below. You can put as many polygons as you want per [monitor-<mid>]
# (see examples).
#
# detect_pattern: overrides the detection patterns used for this monitor.

# Examples:

[monitor-7]
# my front door
# here we want anything except potted plant
# exclusion in regular expressions is not
# as straightforward as you may think, so 
# follow this pattern
# detect_pattern = ^(?!object1|object2|objectN)
# the characters in front implement what is 
# called a negative look ahead
