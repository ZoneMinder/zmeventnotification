# The max difference in area between the objects if match_past_detection is on
# can also be specified in px like 300px. Default is 5%. Basically, bounding boxes of the same

# to calculate the difference in areas and based on his tests, 5% worked well. YMMV. Change it if needed.

# quick overview:

# model can be hog or cnn. cnn may be more accurate, but I haven't found it to be

# When we are first training the face recognition model with known faces,
# by default we use hog because we assume you will supply well lit, front facing faces
# However, if you are planning to train with profile photos or hard to see faces, you
# may want to change this to cnn. Note that this increases training time, but training only
# happens once, unless you retrain again by removing the training model
