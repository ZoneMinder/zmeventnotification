## Monitor specific settings
#
# - Format:  [monitor-<mid>]
#
# Parameters:
# polygon areas where object detection will be done.
# You can name them anything except the keywords defined in the optional
# params below. You can put as many polygons as you want per [monitor-<mid>]
# (see examples).
#
# detect_pattern: overrides the detection patterns used for this monitor.
#
# Examples:

# [monitor-11]
# my driveway
# detect_pattern=(person|car|motorbike|bus|truck|boat)
# my_driveway_perimeter=307,315 1276,295 1279,719 0,719
# my_front_yard=307,315 320,315 320,400 307,400

# [monitor-7]
# my front door
# here we want anything except potted plant
# exclusion in regular expressions is not
# as straightforward as you may think, so 
# follow this pattern
# detect_pattern = ^(?!object1|object2|objectN)
# the characters in front implement what is 
# called a negative look ahead

# detect_pattern=^(?!potted plant)

# [monitor-2]
# my basement
# detect_pattern=(person)
# detect_pattern=^(?!chair|bed)
# param=219,304 1113,278 1066,863 177,852


#[monitor-4]
# detect_pattern=(cat|dog)
# kitchen_door=313,221 392,210 418,592 367,659

# No 'detect_pattern', global value would be used.
# [monitor-7]
