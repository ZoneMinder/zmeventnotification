## Key Changes: ES 7.0 vs ES 6.x

### Configuration: Full migration from INI/JSON to YAML
- **All config files migrated to YAML** — `zmeventnotification.ini`, `secrets.ini`, `es_rules.json`, and `objectconfig.ini` are replaced by `.yml` equivalents
- Legacy INI/JSON files moved to `legacy/` directory for reference
- Migration tools provided: `config_migrate_yaml.py`, `es_config_migrate_yaml.py`, `config_upgrade_yaml.py`
- The `{{}}` templating system in objectconfig is removed; `ml_sequence` is now inlined directly in YAML

### Object Detection: YOLOv26 ONNX via OpenCV DNN
- **Added support for YOLOv26 ONNX models** — supposed to be accuracy improvement. You will need to upgrade OpenCV 
- Installer (`install.sh`) can download ONNX models automatically (`INSTALL_YOLOV11` flag)

### Architecture: Modular Perl codebase
- **Monolithic `zmeventnotification.pl` broken into 10 modules** under `ZmEventNotification/` (Config, DB, Rules, FCM, MQTT, HookProcessor, WebSocketHandler, etc.)
- ~60 individual config variables replaced with 10 grouped hashes
- Logging switched from custom `printDebug/printInfo/printError` to ZoneMinder's native logging

### New Features
- **Detected objects are now tagged in the ZoneMinder database** (Tags table with CreateDate)
- `fcm_service_account_file` config option added for FCM auth (if you are compiling zmNg from source, you don't need a central push server)

### Installer Improvements
- Dependency checks and Perl module auto-install added

### Testing
- Comprehensive Perl test suite added (`t/`) covering constants, config parsing, rules, hook processor logic, and contract formatting
- Test fixtures with sample YAML configs
