Note
-----
The master branch is always cutting edge. If you are packaging the ES into your own system/image it is recommended you use the [latest stable release](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventnotification/releases/latest). See [this note](https://zmeventnotification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/install.html#installation-of-the-event-server-es).


What
----
The Event Notification Server sits along with ZoneMinder and offers real time notifications, support for push notifications as well as Machine Learning powered recognition.
As of today, it supports:
* detection of 80 types of objects (persons, cars, etc.) 
* face recognition
* deep license plate recognition

I will add more algorithms over time.
