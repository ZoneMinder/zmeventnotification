What
----
The Event Notification Server sits along with ZoneMinder and offers real time notifications, support for push notifications as well as Machine Learning powered recognition.
As of today, it supports:
* detection of 80 types of objects (persons, cars, etc.) 
* face recognition
* deep license plate recognition

I will add more algorithms over time.
